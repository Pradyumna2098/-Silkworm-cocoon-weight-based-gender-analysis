# -Silkworm-cocoon-weight-based-gender-analysis
This project lets us pre-specify the gender of the cocoon from the weight of the silkworm by helping us choose the finest quality silk threads for textiles and other purposes.
Each individual cocoon with genders male and female, dead weight is taken into consideration as samples.
Weight analysis is conducted on various samples using a HX711 load weight sensor. Based on the reading from the load cell a servo motor is used to segregate the type of cocoon.
